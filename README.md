# ACWGANGP
`train_ACWGANGP.py` provides the reference implementation of ACWGANGP as proposed in our [paper](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2019/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2019_149.pdf).

In the `dataset` folder, you'll find `UHCS128_Images.h5` which contains the microstructure images and `UHCS128_labels.h5` containing the corresponding labels.

The `conda_env` folder contains a yaml file that archived the conda environment used for this project in 2019.

Please cite our [paper](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2019/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2019_149.pdf) if you use this code.
